<h1 id="what-is-cyber-security">What is Cyber Security?</h1>
<p>Cyber security generally refers to the ability to control access to networked systems and the information they contain.</p>
<p>Where cyber security controls are effective is known as cyberspace and is <strong>considered a reliable, resilient, and trustworthy digital Infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p>Where cyber security controls are absent, Incomplete, or poorly designed, <strong>cyberspace is considered the wild west of the digital age.</strong></p>
<p>Whether a system is a physical facility or a collection of cyberspace components, the role of a security professional assigned to that system is to plan for potential attack and prepare for its consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The goals of cybersecurity-</strong>  <em>prevent,  detect, respond</em></li>
<li><strong>The means to achieve cyber security-</strong>  <em>people, process, technology</em></li>
<li><strong>The mechanisms by which cyber security goals are achieved:</strong>  <em>confidentiality, Integrity, and availability.</em></li>
<li><em>Prevent, detect, respond</em> addresses goals common to both physical and cyber security.</li>
<li><em>People, process, technology</em> addresses methods common to both technology management In general and to cyber security management as a specialized field.</li>
<li><em>Confidentiality, integrity, and availability</em> addresses the security objective that are specific to Information.
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality refers <span>to</span>  <span>data, objects and resources are protected from unauthorized viewing and other access.</span></li>
<li>Integrity refers to <span>data is protected from unauthorized changes to ensure that it is reliable and correct.</span> .</li>
<li>Availability refers to <span>that authorized users have access to the systems and the resources they need.</span></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-cyber-security-policy">What Is Cyber Security Policy?</h1>
<p>The tension between demand for cyber functionality and requirements for security is addressed through cyber security policy.</p>
<p>The word “policy” has been used to refer to laws and regulations concerning information distribution, private enterprise objectives for information protection, computer operations methods for controlling technology, and configuration variables in electronic devices (Gallaher, Link et al. 2008).</p>
<h1 id="cyber-security-policy">Cyber Security Policy</h1>
<h1 id="cyber-security-policy-perspectives">Cyber Security Policy perspectives</h1>
<p>In Figure 1.2, the links to and from the “governance bodies” node illustrate that cyber security policy is adopted by governing bodies as a method of achieving security goals. The figure is purposely generic as governing bodies often exist outside of the organizations that they govern <span>.</span></p>
<h1 id="domains-of-cyber-security-policy">Domains of Cyber Security Policy</h1>
<p>Where security is a priority for an organization, it iscommon to see cyber security policies Issued by multiple Internal departments with overlapping constituencies, who then sometimes detect policy incompatibility issues in trying to follow them all simultaneously.</p>
<p>1.  laws and Regulations</p>
<p>Nation-state cyber security policy Is currently considered to be a subset of national security policy. Even if nation-state cyber security policy was considered to be on the same plane as foreign policy or economic policy, these  policies do not have the same force as law.</p>
<p>Policies are established and articulated through report and speeches, through talking points and negotiations</p>
<p>Policies is used to guide Judgement on what laws and regulations to consider.</p>
<p>It does not refer to the laws and regulation’s themselves..</p>
<p>Enterprise Policy</p>
<p>Private sector organizations are generally not <em>as</em> constrained as governments in turning senior management policies Into actionable rules. In a corporate environment, It Is typical that polices are expected to be followed upon threat of sanction to and Including employment termination.</p>
<p>Technology Operations</p>
<p>In an effort to assist clients in complying with legal and regulatory information security requirements, the  legal accounting, and consulting profession’s have adopted standard. for due diligence with respect to Information security, and recommended that clients model processes around them. These were sometimes proprietary to the consulting firm, but were often based on published standards such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</p>
<p><em>Recommended Security Controls for Federal</em>  <em>lnformation</em>  <em>Systems</em> and their private sector counter-parts.</p>
<p><span>4.Technology Configuration</span></p>
<p>Because many technology operations standards are implemented using specialized security software and devices, technology operators often colloquially refer to the standard-specified technical configuration or these devices as "security policy“. These specifications have <em>over</em> the years been implemented by vendors and service providers, who devised technical configurations of computing devices that would allow system administrators to claim compliance with various standards.</p>
<h1 id="strategy-versus-policy">Strategy versus Policy</h1>
<p>Cyber security policy articulates the strategy for cyber security goal achievement and provides its constituents with direction for the appropriate use of cyber security measures.</p>
<p>Without a clear conceptual view of cyber security Influences, It would be difficult to devise cyber security strategy and corresponding policy.</p>
<p>Key to cyber security policy formulation ls:</p>
<p>to recognize that security control decisions are made regardless of whether there is a formal policy  in place,</p>
<p>to understand that Policy is the appropriate tool to guide multiple independently made security decisions, and</p>
<p>to absorb as much Information as possible about how security decisions are Influenced In the course or devising security strategy.</p>
<h1 id="cyber-security-management-cycle">Cyber security management cycle</h1>
<p><span>Individual policy statements are</span>  <span>usually debated in the course of cyber security strategy development, and</span>  <span>they are an outcome of it.</span></p>
<p><span>When fully articulated, policy statements are</span>  <span>used to facilitate awareness of cyber security strategy to individuals responsible for its execution. The awareness program is done for</span>  <span>policy</span>  <span>compliance</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>motivate</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>implementation</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>policy-compliant</span>  <span>systems.</span></p>
<p><span>policy</span>  <span>compliance</span>  <span>is</span>  <span>monitored. Monitoring may be continuous via automated sensors, periodic</span>  <span>checks</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>balances,</span>  <span>and/or</span>  <span>it</span>  <span>may</span>  <span>be</span>  <span>intermittent,</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>lifecycle</span>  <span>review</span>  <span>process.</span>  <span>Where</span>  <span>such</span>  <span>monitoring</span>  <span>identifies</span>  <span>issues</span>  <span>with</span>  <span>policy</span>  <span>compliance,</span>  <span>or cyber security incidents that are not anticipated by policy, remediation</span>  <span>plans</span>  <span>are</span>  <span>considered.</span></p>
<p><span>Where</span>  <span>no</span>  <span>remediation</span>  <span>plan</span>  <span>is</span>  <span>considered</span>  <span>feasible,</span>  <span>this</span>  <span>feedback</span>  <span>is</span>  <span>consumed</span>  <span>by</span>  <span>cyber</span>  <span>security</span>  <span>strategists,</span>  <span>who</span>  <span>use</span>  <span>it</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>refine</span>  <span>policy</span>  <span>.</span></p>

<p>Process got automated with goal to increase in Productivity that replaced human calculators with automated programs producing more accurate results.</p>
<p>IntroductionoftheInternetfurther enabled productivity by allowing quick and accurate communication of information.</p>
<p>Online Transactions came into action.</p>
<p>e- Commerce took the market.</p>
<p>By 2000, the economy had become so dependent one-commerce that it was a frequent target of cyber criminals, and securitytechnologyevolvedtoprotectdatathatcouldbeusedtocommitfraudulenttransactions.</p>
<h1 id="productivity">Productivity</h1>
<p>Evolution started in 1960s <span>with the mainframe.</span></p>
<p><span>the first type of computer that was affordable enough for businesses</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>see</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>return</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>investment</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>electronic</span>  <span>data</span>  <span>processing</span>  <span>systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Computers were secured with guards and gates.</span></p>
<p><span>Physical</span>  <span>security procedures were devised to ensure that only people authorized to</span>  <span>work on computers had physical access to them.</span></p>
<p><span>Large systems to work with.</span></p>
<p><span>By</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>late</span>  <span>1960s,</span>  <span>remote</span>  <span>job</span>  <span>entry</span>  <span>allowed</span>  <span>punched</span>  <span>cards</span>  <span>to be received from multiple office locations connected via cables to the</span>  <span>main computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Computers security staff responsible for tracing this cables under raised</span>  <span>floors,and</span>  <span>though wall spaces to check the authorized person at work</span></p>
<p>Accuteaware of security risk</p>
<p>Confidentiality, integrity and availability triad was not yet industry standard.</p>
<p>Apart from military and intelligence, confidentiality was not the major security requirement</p>
<p>Catastrophic data integrity error from hum entries.</p>
<p>Software engineering organizations were the first to raise the security alarm because computers were starting to control systems where faulty operations could put lives at Risk.</p>
<p><strong>In 1970s,</strong></p>
<p>punched cards were replaced by electronic input andoutputviakeyboardsandterminals</p>
<p>Cables extended for internet working</p>
<p>Securitypersonnelswere not safe guarding</p>
<p>Screens were limited by business logic coded into the software.</p>
<p>For example, a supervisor observing the customer service clerkcouldenteraspecialcodetoallowaone-timebalancechangeoperationthroughtheotherwiselimitedscreenfunctionality.</p>
<p>Concepts of cryptography was introduced.</p>
<p>Data units encrypted using private keys and decrypted back to original  message at destination</p>
<p>In recognition of growing confidentiality requirements, but without any good way to meet them, the US National bureau of standards <span>(now the national Institute of Standards and Technology [</span>  <span>N</span>  <span>IST]) launched an effort to achieve</span>  <span>consensus</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>national</span>  <span>encryption</span>  <span>standard.</span></p>
<p><span>In</span>  <span>1974,</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>U</span>  <span>.S</span>  <span>Computer</span>  <span>Security Act (Privacy Act) was the first stake in the ground designed to</span>  <span>establish control over information propagation.</span></p>
<p><span>Later the word processing software were implemented for work automation</span></p>
<p><span>Timesharing system where introduced where clients were charged for system use</span></p>
<p><span>Companies began to specialized  by industry, developing complicated software such as payroll tax calculation and commercial lease calculations</span></p>
<p><span>User identification through user name and password</span></p>
<p>From  1970 to  1980, minicomputers became attract human for personal use.</p>
<p>In late 1970, Apple introduced home computers.</p>
<p>In  1981 , IBM introduced Personal Computer (PC).</p>
<p>The local area network  (LAN) cables were protected much like the computer terminals’ connection to the mainframe.</p>
<p>A newtype of  network equipment called a hub allowed the communication, and hubs had to be kept in a secure area.</p>
<p>Mandatory  access controls  (MAC) allowed  management to label Computer objects (programs and files) and specify the subjects (users) who could access them.</p>
<p>Discretionary  schemes  (DAC)  that  allowed  each  user to specify  who could access their files.</p>
<p>Timesharing-type password technology was employed on LAN. LAN  user names were  primarily supported  to facilitate directory  services rather than to prevent determined attack.</p>
<p><span>Cyberspace presented a new</span>  <span>avenue of inquiry for law enforcement investigating traditional crimes.</span></p>
<p><span>Criminals</span>  <span>were</span>  <span>caught</span>  <span>boasting</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>their</span>  <span>crimes</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>social</span>  <span>networking</span>  <span>sites of the day, which were electronic bulletin board services reached by</span>  <span>modems</span>  <span>over</span>  <span>phone</span>  <span>lines.</span></p>
<p><span>Law enforcement partnered with</span>  <span>technology</span>  <span>vendors</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>produce</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>would</span>  <span>recover</span>  <span>files</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>crimi</span>  <span>-</span>  <span>nals</span>  <span>had</span>  <span>attempted</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>delete</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>computers.</span></p>
<p><span>Cyberspace</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>1980s.</span></p>
<p><img src="img/CS-11.png" alt=""></p>
<p><span>D</span>  <span>irectory services were available</span>  <span>that allowed businesses to connect, and be connected to, the research</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>military</span>  <span>restricted</span>  <span>advanced</span>  <span>research</span>  <span>projects</span>  <span>agency</span>  <span>(ARPA)</span>  <span>network,</span>  <span>or</span>  <span> <em>ARPANET</em> </span>  <span>, whose use case and name were relaxed as it evolved into</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>public</span>  <span> <em>Internet</em> </span>  <span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Technology-savvy</span>  <span>companies</span>  <span>quickly</span>  <span>registered their domain names so that they could own their own corner of</span>  <span>cyberspace.</span></p>
<p><span>R</span>  <span>esearchers were concerned with the potential for</span>  <span>system abuse due to the exponential expansion of the numbers of connected</span>  <span>computers.</span></p>
<p><span> <strong>Robert</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>Morris</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>at</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>Bell</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>Laboratories.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span> <strong>early computer pioneer</strong> </span>  <span> <strong>:</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>In 1988, Robert Tappan Morris devised the</span>  <span>first Internet worm.</span></p>
<p><span>The “Morris Worm” accessed computers used as email</span>  <span>servers, exploited vulnerabilities to identify all the computers that were</span>  <span>known</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>each</span>  <span>email</span>  <span>server,</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>then</span>  <span>contacted</span>  <span>all</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>those</span>  <span>computers</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>attempted</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>same</span>  <span>exploits.</span></p>
<p><span>Internet communication</span>  <span>virtually stopped with few hours, computing resources were so overwhelmed by the</span>  <span>worm’s activities that they had no processing cycles or network bandwidth</span>  <span>left</span>  <span>for</span>  <span>transaction</span>  <span>processing,</span>  <span>leaving</span>  <span>business</span>  <span>processes</span>  <span>disrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>But APARNET was saved they have installed FIREWALL(A method of inspecting each individual information packet within a stream of network traffic).</span></p>
<p><span>The</span>  <span>firewall</span>  <span>was</span>  <span>designed</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>allow</span>  <span>network</span>  <span>access</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>only</span>  <span>those</span>  <span>packets</span>  <span>whose</span>  <span> <em>source</em> </span>  <span>and</span>  <span> <em>destination</em> </span>  <span>matched</span>  <span>those</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>previously</span>  <span>authorized list.</span></p>
<p><span>N</span>  <span>etwork</span>  <span>addresses</span>  <span>and port number used for communication.</span></p>
<p><span>The Bell</span>  <span>Labs firewall was hastily employed to safeguard AT&amp;T’s email servers, and</span>  <span>the impact to AT&amp;T from the Morris worm was minimal.</span></p>
<p><span>The primary cyber security implementation strategy of choice</span>  <span>since</span>  <span>then</span>  <span>has</span>  <span>been</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>deploy</span>  <span>firewalls.</span></p>
<p><span>Computer</span>  <span>Emergency</span>  <span>Response</span>  <span>Team</span>  <span>(CERT)</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>provide</span>  <span>technical</span>  <span>assistance to those who suffered from cyber security problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Same type of</span>  <span>vulnarabilities</span>  <span>like Morris worm in Internet-facing email servers exists in systems that presented modem interface to the public.</span></p>
<p>Most Hacker interested for stealing some system time to play games without information to vulnerable users system.</p>
<p>Hackers who steal time to play are Joyriders.</p>
<p>By1992, few hackers have profit motives.</p>
<p><span>in 1986, Cliff Stoll, noticed a billing error in the range of 75 cents of computer time that</span>  <span>was not associated with any of</span>  <span>hisusers</span>  <span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Stoll ended up tracking the missing</span>  <span>cents</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>computing</span>  <span>time</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>an</span>  <span>Eastern</span>  <span>European</span>  <span>espionage</span>  <span>ring.</span></p>
<p><span>published</span>  <span>detective Article called</span>  <span> <em>The</em> </span>  <span> <em>Cuckoo’s</em> </span>  <span> <em>Egg</em> </span>  <span>. (lock the system via modems)</span></p>
<p><span>no firewall-like technology for phones.</span></p>
<p><span>caller Id and dial-back.</span></p>
<p><span>Caller id checks the authorization of caller from database.</span></p>
<p><span>Dial-back calls back the caller on checking the validity of called number.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe at Dial-back modems, it became easy to surf in home network and other region.</span></p>
<h1 id="cyberspace-in-the-early-1990s.">Cyberspace in the early 1990s.</h1>
<p><span>The devices represent the logical location of</span>  <span>the firewalls and telecommunication line connections to other firms.</span></p>
<p><span>The</span>  <span>telecommunication lines are portrayed as logically segmented spaces</span>  <span>where lines to business partners terminate on the internal network. private</span>  <span>lines</span></p>
<p><span>all these network periphery controls did not prevent the</span>  <span>hackers and joyriders from disrupting computer operations with viruses</span>  <span>.</span></p>
<p><span>viruses were distributed on floppy disks and</span>  <span>also</span>  <span>planted</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>websites</span>  <span>for</span>  <span>advertisement to corporate and government Internet</span>  <span>users.</span></p>
<p><strong>Actions on Virus:</strong></p>
<p><span>D</span>  <span>igital signature were created for</span>  <span>each</span>  <span>virus</span>  <span>by</span>  <span>identifying</span>  <span>each</span>  <span>file</span>  <span>it</span>  <span>altered</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>types</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>logs</span>  <span>it</span>  <span>left</span>  <span>behind.</span></p>
<p><span>Anti-virus software were created and Digital Signatures of each virus were recorded.</span></p>
<p><span>Software security flaws and Bugs were detected by Cyber Forensics.</span></p>
<p><span>As the</span>  <span>signature that identified one virus was not tied to the software flaw but to</span>  <span>the files deposited by the virus itself, a virus writer could slightly modify</span>  <span>his</span>  <span>or</span>  <span>her</span>  <span>code</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>take</span>  <span>advantage</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>same</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>vulnerability</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>evade detection by antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>Updation</span>  <span>of Anti-virus Software.</span></p>
<p><span>Locally the software bugs were repaired known as PATCHES.</span></p>
<p><span>Its origin in the</span>  <span>context</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>computers</span>  <span>referred</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>cable</span>  <span>plugged</span>  <span>into</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>wall</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>vacuum</span>  <span>tubes</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>altered</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>course</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>electronic</span>  <span>processing</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>an</span>  <span>analog</span>  <span>computer by physically changing the path of code execution.</span></p>
<p><span>Patches are small files that must frequently be installed on complex soft-</span>  <span>ware in order to prevent an adversary from exploiting vulnerable code and</span>  <span>thereby</span>  <span>causing damage to systems or information.</span></p>
<p><span>vulnerabilities in software became the</span>  <span>source of what was then called “the port 80 problem”.</span></p>
<p><span>Port 80 is the port</span>  <span>on a firewall that has to be open in order for external users to access web</span>  <span>services.</span></p>
<p><span>Starting</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>port</span>  <span>80</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>server</span>  <span>facing</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>Internet,</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>web</span>  <span>server</span>  <span>program</span>  <span>was designed to accept user commands instructing it to display content,</span>  <span>but it would also allow commands instructing it to accept and execute</span>  <span>programs provided by a user.</span></p>
<p><span>The immediate</span>  <span>result of the port 80 problem analysis was that firewalls were installed not</span>  <span>just</span>  <span>at</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>network</span>  <span>periphery</span>  <span>but</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>virtual</span>  <span>circle</span>  <span>around</span>  <span>any</span>  <span>machine</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>faced</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>A Demilitarized Zone (</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>MZ) network architecture became the new</span>  <span>security</span>  <span>standard.</span>  <span>(</span>  <span>Bell</span>  <span>Labs)</span></p>
<p><span>A</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>MZ was an area of the network that allowed Internet</span>  <span>access</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>well-defined</span>  <span>set</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>specific</span>  <span>services.</span></p>

<p><span>It became</span>  <span>standard procedure that the path to the internal network was opened only</span>  <span>with the express approval of a security architect, who was responsible for</span>  <span>testing the security controls on all</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>MZ and internally accessible software.</span></p>
<p>The huge growth of e-commerce was envied by the competing sites. <span>sites</span>  <span>attempted to stop the flow of e-commerce to competitors by intentionally</span>  <span>consuming all the available bandwidth allowed through the competitor</span>  <span>firewall</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>competitor</span>  <span>websites.</span></p>

<p><span>The shade of gray used to identify security technology is the same</span>  <span>throughout the diagram. The dashed line encircles the equipment that is</span>  <span>typically</span>  <span>found</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>dMZ</span>  <span>.</span></p>
<h1 id="e-commerce">E-commerce</h1>
<p>e-Commerce established connection between market and customer in device.</p>
<p><span>The first such sites were</span>  <span>fraught with</span>  <span>risk of fraud and threats to confidentiality because of the</span>  <span>number of telecommunications devices that suddenly gained unfettered</span>  <span>access</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>customer</span>  <span>information,</span>  <span>including</span>  <span>credit</span>  <span>card</span>  <span>numbers.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1995, a new encrypted communications protocol called Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</span></p>
<p><span>In 1999, the</span>  <span>protocol was enhanced by committee and codified under the name Trans-</span>  <span>port Layer Security (TLS</span>  <span> <strong>)</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The</span>  <span>TLS</span>  <span>protocol</span>  <span>requires</span>  <span>web</span>  <span>servers</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>have</span>  <span>long</span>  <span>identification</span>  <span>strings,</span>  <span>called</span>  <span>certificates.</span></p>
<p><span>The software</span>  <span>allowed them to create a</span>  <span> <em>root</em> </span>  <span>certificate for their company, and the root</span>  <span>certification was used to generate server certificates for each company web</span>  <span>server.</span></p>
<p><span>For</span>  <span>critical</span>  <span>applications that facilitated high asset value transactions, certificates could</span>  <span>also</span>  <span>be</span>  <span>generated</span>  <span>for</span>  <span>each</span>  <span>customer,</span>  <span>which</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>SSL</span>  <span>protocol</span>  <span>referred</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>a</span>  <span> <em>client</em> </span>  <span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The</span>  <span>SSL</span>  <span>protocol</span>  <span>thus</span>  <span>made</span>  <span>use</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>certificates</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>identify</span>  <span>client</span>  <span>to server and server to client.</span></p>
<p><span>once mutually identified, both sides would</span>  <span>use</span>  <span>data</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>certificates</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>generate</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>single</span>  <span>new</span>  <span>key</span>  <span>they</span>  <span>both</span>  <span>would</span>  <span>use</span>  <span>for</span>  <span>encrypted</span>  <span>communication.</span></p>
<p><span>This</span>  <span>allows</span>  <span>each</span>  <span>web</span>  <span>session</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>look</span>  <span>different</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>point</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>view</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>an</span>  <span>observer</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>network,</span>  <span>even</span>  <span>if</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>same information, such as the same credentials, are transmitted.</span></p>
<p><span> <em>Identity</em> </span>  <span> <em>management systems</em> </span>  <span>were developed to ease the administration and integrate</span>  <span>customer</span>  <span>login</span>  <span>information</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>online</span>  <span>activity</span>  <span>with</span>  <span>existing</span>  <span>customer</span>  <span>relationship</span>  <span>management</span>  <span>processes.</span></p>
<p><span>Security strategies were devised to control</span>  <span>and monitor code development, testing, and production environments.</span></p>
<p><span>Source code control and change detection systems became standard cyber</span>  <span>security</span>  <span>equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>R</span>  <span>emote access still required two-factor</span>  <span>authentication, and this was judged an adequate way to maintain access</span>  <span>control, particularly when combined with other safeguards, such as a</span>  <span>control</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>prevents</span>  <span>a</span>  <span>user</span>  <span>from</span>  <span>being</span>  <span>able</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>have</span>  <span>two</span>  <span>simultaneous</span>  <span>sessions.</span></p>
<p><span>To maintain confidentiality of customer information, the entire remote access session would have to be</span>  <span>encrypted.</span>  <span> <em>Virtual</em> </span>  <span> <em>private</em> </span>  <span> <em>network</em> </span>  <span>(</span>  <span>V</span>  <span>PP)</span>  <span>technology</span></p>

<p><span>The</span>  <span>idea</span>  <span>behind</span>  <span>IDS</span>  <span>was</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>same</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>behind</span>  <span>signature-based</span>  <span>antivirus</span>  <span>technology,</span></p>

<p><span> <em>Security</em> </span>  <span> <em>policy</em> </span>  <span> <em>servers</em> </span>  <span>were</span>  <span>established</span>  <span>to keep track of which configuration variables were supposed to be on</span>  <span>which</span>  <span>device.</span></p>

<p><span>Security policy servers economically</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>effectively</span>  <span>allowed</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>technology</span>  <span>configurations</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>be</span>  <span>centrally</span>  <span>monitored</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>managed</span>  <span>.</span></p>

<h1 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures</h1>
<p>Technology could not stop the success rate of cyber attack.</p>
<p>New attack came into force like:</p>
<p>Malware: <span>malicious software/ sites</span></p>
<p><span> <em>phishing</em> </span>  <span>and</span>  <span> <em>pharming</em> </span>  <span> <em>:</em> </span>  <span>redirecting to malicious addresses</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>look-alike</span>  <span>sites.</span></p>
<p><span>Spyware</span>  <span>:</span>  <span>send user names and passwords to criminal data collection websites</span></p>
<p><span>And many more………</span></p>
<p><span>The concern of the cyber security Expert was to focus on prevention of all such cybercrimes.</span></p>
<p><span>The countermeasures were dictated for the prevention of Cyber Attacks.</span></p>
<p>Data thefts through laptops, stolen devices.</p>
<p>Remote user backup there data on USB devices.</p>
<p>Some steps were taken to destroy all data on the devices through software and programming technologies in case of device theft.</p>
<p>Vendorshastlyprovided methods to encrypt laptop disks and USB devices.</p>
<p>Companies adopted standards and procedures for the authorized use of digital media, and restricted access to the devices.</p>
<p>Many devices were being encrypted, it became difficult for administrators to keep up with procedures to safeguard encryption keys.</p>
<p><span>Simple key management</span>  <span>systems such as password-protected key databases were used in1990s,but later landed in trouble of huge generation of keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Security vendors stepped in with automated key storage and</span>  <span>retrieval</span>  <span>systems.</span></p>
<p><span>keys</span>  <span>are</span>  <span>stored</span>  <span>on</span>  <span>special</span>  <span>hardware</span>  <span>chips</span>  <span>physically protected in isolated locations and accessible only by the equipment</span>  <span>used to control access to the devices.</span></p>
<p><span>This created trouble in decryption when required at different locations.</span></p>
<p><span>Not such security is designed for E mails server since Morris warm Attack.</span></p>
<p><span>No proper agreements are used for encryption on both ends.</span></p>
<p>Attempts are made to identify authorized emails servers via Certificates like keys.</p>
<p><span>Email security vendors created software to assist in the analysis</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>email</span>  <span>content,</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>many</span>  <span>companies</span>  <span>who</span>  <span>suspected</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>confidential</span>  <span>data such as PII was being sent via email for work-at-home purposes</span>  <span>thereby</span>  <span>found</span>  <span>that</span>  <span>many</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>their</span>  <span>business</span>  <span>processes</span>  <span>routinely</span>  <span>emailed</span>  <span>such</span>  <span>data to customer or service providers.</span></p>
<p><span>Internal users</span>  <span>ignore</span>  <span>security</span>  <span>policy.</span></p>

<p><span>The</span>  <span>network</span>  <span>control</span>  <span>of</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>dMZ</span>  <span>does not prevent a web software developer from deploying code that can</span>  <span>be used to imitate any network activity that is allowed by the web server</span>  <span>itself.</span></p>
<p><span>developers</span>  <span>innovate</span>  <span>by</span>  <span>sharing</span>  <span>the</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>source code via both public (“open source”) and proprietary development</span>  <span>projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Reusing the codes for more functionality.</span></p>

<p><span>Like the lists of viruses and</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>vulnerabilities,</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>security</span>  <span>mistakes</span>  <span>have</span>  <span>been</span>  <span>cataloged</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>part of the national vulnerability database project (MITRE 2009; MITRE</span>  <span>ongoing).</span></p>
<p><span>Cyber security vendors have created security source code</span>  <span>analy</span>  <span>-</span>  <span>sis software to be incorporated into source code control systems so these</span>  <span>bugs</span>  <span>can</span>  <span>be</span>  <span>found</span>  <span>before</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>is</span>  <span>deployed.</span></p>
<p><span>Static</span>  <span>software</span>  <span>analysis,</span>  <span>which</span>  <span>reads</span>  <span>code</span>  <span>as</span>  <span>written.</span></p>
<p>Dynamic software analysis, which reads code as it is being executed. <em>Web access firewalls</em> (WAFWs), are programmed to detect insecure software as <span>it</span>  <span>is</span>  <span>used,</span>  <span>and</span>  <span>block</span>  <span>attempts</span>  <span>to</span>  <span>exploit</span>  <span>it</span>  <span>in</span>  <span>real</span>  <span>time.</span></p>
